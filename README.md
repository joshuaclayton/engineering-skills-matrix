# Software Development Skills Matrix

## What?

This is a small [Elm] application allowing software developers to gauge skills
and interest across a few different types of responsibilities in order to guide
conversations around career growth into management, lead, or senior technical
roles.

[Elm]: https://elm-lang.org/

## Getting Set Up

```sh
bin/setup
```

## Developing Locally

Ensure that `elm-format` runs on file save.

To start the application, run:

```sh
npm run start
```

[Parcel] will provide a port to view on localhost (1234 is the default).

[Parcel]: https://parceljs.org

## Building for Deployment

```sh
npm run build
```

This will compile assets into the `dist/` directory.
